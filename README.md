## Churn Prediction 📊

---

#### Introduction:
Churn prediction is a challenge posed to understand and tackle the issue of clients closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions. The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. For the concerned financial institution, the churn rate is above 15% and rising. Our mission is to:
- Predict clients with a higher propensity to close their bank account with the financial institution.
- Identify possible groups of clients and describe their characteristics.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial visualizations were used to understand the distribution of the data. Data preprocessing steps included separating features and target variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Implementation**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 96.2% on the testing data.
  - **XGBoost Classifier**: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and achieved a score of approximately 97.1% with the best parameters.
