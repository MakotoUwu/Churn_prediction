## Churn Prediction 📊

---

#### Introduction:
Churn prediction is a challenge posed to understand and tackle the issue of clients closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions. The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. For the concerned financial institution, the churn rate is above 15% and rising. Our mission is to:
- Predict clients with a higher propensity to close their bank account with the financial institution.
- Identify possible groups of clients and describe their characteristics.

---

#### Must-have Features:
- Implementation of machine learning models according to the client's requirements.
- Clearly defined performance metrics of the model.
- Evaluation of the model's performance and definition of its limitations.
- Exploration of different unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Explanation of the results obtained using unsupervised learning.

#### Dataset:
The dataset can be downloaded from the provided link: [Credit Card Customers](#) (Please replace `#` with the actual link).

---

#### Analysis Overview:
- **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded from the provided CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial visualizations were used to understand the distribution of the data. Data preprocessing steps included separating features and target variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Implementation**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 96.2% on the testing data.
  - **XGBoost Classifier**: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and achieved a score of approximately 97.1% with the best parameters.

#### Recommendations:
Focus retention campaigns on customers with significant changes in transaction count or amount, as these might be indicators of churn.
Offer personalized incentives to older customers or those with a high number of contacts in the last 12 months.
Implement a feedback mechanism to proactively understand and address reasons for churn.
