## Churn Prediction 📊

---

#### Introduction:
Churn prediction is a challenge posed to understand and tackle the issue of clients closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions. The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. For the concerned financial institution, the churn rate is above 15% and rising. Our mission is to:
- Predict clients with a higher propensity to close their bank account with the financial institution.
- Identify possible groups of clients and describe their characteristics.

---

#### Must-have Features:
- Implementation of machine learning models according to the client's requirements.
- Clearly defined performance metrics of the model.
- Evaluation of the model's performance and definition of its limitations.
- Exploration of different unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Explanation of the results obtained using unsupervised learning.

#### Dataset:
The dataset can be downloaded from the provided link: [Credit Card Customers](#) (Please replace `#` with the actual link).

---

#### Analysis Overview:
- **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded from the provided CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial visualizations were used to understand the distribution of the data. Data preprocessing steps included separating features and target variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Implementation**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 96.2% on the testing data.
  - **XGBoost Classifier**: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and achieved a score of approximately 97.1% with the best parameters.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Based on the characteristics of clients identified as likely to churn, design targeted marketing campaigns to offer them incentives, discounts, or personalized deals. This can enhance customer loyalty and reduce the churn rate.
2. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism to understand why clients are leaving. Their feedback can provide invaluable insights into areas of improvement for the institution.
3. **Regular Model Updates**: Machine learning models should be regularly updated with fresh data to ensure their accuracy remains high. Periodic retraining can help in adapting to any new patterns in customer behavior.
4. **Client Segmentation**: The clusters identified through unsupervised learning can be further used for client segmentation. Designing specific campaigns for each segment can be more effective in client retention.
5. **Enhance Customer Service**: Often, one of the main reasons for churn can be dissatisfaction with customer service. Improving customer service and offering dedicated helplines for grievance redressal can be beneficial.
6. **Monitor Competitor Offerings**: Keep a close eye on the offerings and services provided by competitors. Matching or surpassing their offerings can be a way to retain clients who might be considering switching.
